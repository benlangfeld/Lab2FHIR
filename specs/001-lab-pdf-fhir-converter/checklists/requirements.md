# Specification Quality Checklist: Lab PDF to FHIR Converter

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - Ready for planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Validation Date**: 2026-02-14
**Result**: ✅ PASS - All criteria met

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) enabling incremental development
- Comprehensive functional requirements (36 FRs) covering all system aspects
- Strong Constitution alignment maintaining deterministic behavior and source traceability
- Measurable success criteria (10 SCs) with specific metrics
- Well-defined edge cases and acceptance scenarios

## Notes

✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if needed for deeper exploration)
